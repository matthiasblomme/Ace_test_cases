# Ace_test_cases

## Description
Some mixed ace test cases that I created and want to maintain.
Don't expect any fancy stuff here. I've created these because I wanted to
 - test the value of a variable
 - test different ways of modifying a field
 - test how some threads are started
 - quickly explain something with a visual aid
 - debug an issue
 - ...

## Cases

### Backout Count

### Delete Array Contents

### Json To Xml

### Timer and File

### User Defined properties
